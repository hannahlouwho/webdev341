1. I chose Cinzel font because I liked the way it looked. I feel like it gave the page the innocent but refined look I was going for.

2. A system font is a file stored directly on a computer that makes a font available in most applications on a computer. It has to be downloaded and installed before it can be used.
<p>A web-font is a font that is stored in a server and can be displayed on a web page through connection with the file over the internet. It is not always available due to a browser being old or being unable to download the file. Hence why web-safe fonts are available, they're universal fonts that every computer has so it's easy for them to display on every computer.</p>
 <p>Fallback fonts help with issues of web against web safe fonts. A fallback font replaces a less common font with one that is similar and universal.</p>

3. This assignment wasn't very difficult besides getting the stupid font to work. I did a lot of looking at other students work and the example to figure out where I went wrong. I dont think I fixed it so woops. However i did get the structure and flow that I wanted for this book:)
