<pre>Pride and Prejudice</pre></h1>
          <p><b>

  <p>
    <pre><b>
      <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be
on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the
minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you
heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
<p>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
<p>“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.</p>
<p>“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</p>
<p>This was invitation enough.</p>
<p>“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is
taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that
he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and
was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately;
that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of
his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”</p>
<p>“What is his name?”</p>
<p>“Bingley.”</p>
<p>“Is he married or single?”</p>
<p>“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;
four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</p>
<p>“How so? How can it affect them?”</p>
<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome!
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p>
