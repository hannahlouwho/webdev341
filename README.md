In all truth I am taking this class because I have to. I am terrible at coding and I am also not very patient with myself. I am slowly learning that coding takes a lot of patience. Hopefully I can get better at that. I find coding very interestign and I would love to understand it and be able to code well.

* I found it very interesting that coding is the fundamental basis of the entire internet. I didn't exactly realize that coding was so important when it comes to the internet.
* Now I am only 20 years old. Turning 21 soon! Yay! Anyways the internet is only freaking 25 years old?????? I can understand why due to I can still remember that I couldn't be on the computer if my mom was on the phone. Which is weird because I can now google and talk to my friend at the exact same time. On the same device!!
* I did'nt realize exactly how simple code is. It's very complex obviously but its also very very simple
