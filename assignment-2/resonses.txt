1.)IP addresses transfer data between one another. This information is in packages that transfer from IP adress to IP address until they find their destination.

2.)An IP address is an address given to a computer to identify it on any given network. Basically its a computer ID card. A DNS address is a Domain Name Service. This is used to convert alphabetic references into a server's IP address generally for hosting services. Kinda like how people have numbers in a phone book but they really have names.

3.)A web cookie/internet cookie/browser cookie, is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on a user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Too bad its not a real cookie.

4.)The protocol, the paths, and the resource ID.
