## Elements
A page can only have one head and one body element. The head contains information that helps the webpage function and know what to do. This is not visible to the viewer of the page. The body contains everything the viewer of the page will see.

## Markup Differences
Structural markup alters and defines the actual structure of a page, like paragraphs, spacing, indents etc. However, Semantic markup controls specific displays of text and words, for example italics or bold. Semantics relates to the actual "language" of a page and the side communication of the page.

## Work Cycle
ahahaha I took forever... sorry

<p>I used a soup recipe that my friends mom made a long time ago. The coding was fairly easy I however did have issues with that fact that my computer loves to glitch out so that was quit a tug of war getting it to do what I wanted. But all in all good.</p>
